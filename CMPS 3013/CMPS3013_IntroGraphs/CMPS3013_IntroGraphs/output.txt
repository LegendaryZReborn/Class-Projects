Welcome Cavaughn Browne's Make New Friends Program!
This program reads in an adjacency list of peple into a Graph
and then makes introductions between the people who don't
already know each on the list.

Introductions:

Bob is introduced to Kate.
Ann is introduced to Beth.
Mark is introduced to Beth.

Thank You for using Cavaughn Browne's Make New Friends Program.
