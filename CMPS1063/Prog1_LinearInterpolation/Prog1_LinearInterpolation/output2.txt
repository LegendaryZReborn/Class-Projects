Program 1 - LinearInterpolation.cpp
This program reads in a number of pairs of x,y
values (maximum 10) and stores them in a 2
dimensional array It prints out the said
input table to screen and output file. It
then accepts a user input of an x value
that exists between the x values in the
table and calculates the corresponding y value.
The x value and y value are then printed to an
output file and to the screen.
